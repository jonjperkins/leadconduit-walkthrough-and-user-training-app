## **Description**:
Less of a tutorial and more of a guide, this application walks users through the basic concepts necessary to understand and use LeadConduit. A setup wizard guides users through a series of questions in order to tailor the information in the guide for their particular use case (since this can vary significantly between use cases). Users can change the source type at the top right hand of the guide.
